  2.1 - Every long distance inter-city journey must be paid for and evidenced by a ticket, receipt, or official e-ticket screenshot bearing date, time and route.

  6.4 - You must keep the race director updated on your points score throughout the race using the specified method (a webpage) within 2 hours of earning a point. This is to facilitate the pre-invigilation of GPS tracking as well as the points leaderboard.
  6.5 - Bonus Points: Similar to city limits (Rule 4.4), the borders of these regions will use the Google Maps defined limits.
    6.5.1 - If a bonus point area is the only part of that UN member state that you visit, you will still be granted both points: one for the country and one for the bonus.
