Lupine Racing Rules - September 10th, 2025 - v1.3.3

Note: Pay close attention to these rules. Most exist as a result of situations/clarifications in previous events.

Section 1 - Route and Checkpoint Rules

  1.1 - The start line, checkpoints, and finish line must be visited in the order provided.
  1.2 - You must be present at the start line when the race begins, and reach the finish before the cut-off.

  1.4 - The race pack given at the start line will detail the specific evidence needed to validate each checkpoint.

  2.1 - Every long-distance inter-city journey must be paid for and evidenced by a ticket, receipt, or official e-ticket screenshot bearing date, time and route.
    2.1.1 - Fare-free systems: Where a network issues no tickets (e.g., Luxembourg), provide a geo-tagged photo on board showing the destination display.
  2.2 - (Note: This rule is under review for the 2026 season). Region-proof for points rule: A visit only counts if you step off the vehicle and capture one geo-tagged photo of yourself at a clearly recognisable spot outside transport infrastructure, for example a street sign, shop front, town square, or border marker.

Section 3 - Teams

  3.1 - Each team member pays an individual entry fee and must follow all rules as a single entrant.

Section 6 - Country Counting Classification

  6.1 - A point will be awarded for each visit to a unique UN member state, plus Kosovo, Gibraltar and Vatican City. Each event may also have bonus points, detailed below. A point is logged the moment you obtain Section 2 proof issued inside that country.

  6.3 - You must keep the race director updated on your points score throughout the race using the specified method (a webpage) within 2 hours of earning a point. This is to facilitate the pre-invigilation of GPS tracking as well as the points leaderboard.
  6.4 - Bonus Points: Similar to city limits (Rule 4.4), the borders of these regions will use the Google Maps defined limits.
    6.4.1 - If a bonus point area is the only part of that UN member state that you visit, you will still be granted both points: one for the country and one for the bonus.

              1 point - Bornholm, Ã–land, Gotland, Listenbourg, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily
